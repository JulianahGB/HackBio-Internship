#The task is to write a code to generate the specific information about the members of this team without using any complex function, conditionals or loops.
#This is a Python code using separate dictionaries to store the information of the two members of this team and manually generating the output using the print() function.

#the following line of code is used to store the details of team member 1 in a dictionary

team_member_1 = {
    "name" : "Oluwatomiwa Adewunmi",
    "slack_username" : "@julianah",
    "email" : "adewunmitomiwa2018@gmail.com",
    "hobby" : "Reading(mostly fiction)",
    "country" :"Nigeria",
    "discipline" : "Biochemistry",
    "preferred_language" : "Python"

#the choice to use separate dictionaries as opposed to a single one was a personal preference that was made only because there are two members, if there were more and we could use loops we would have gone for a single dictionary.
#the decision was made to prevent the code from looking cumbersome when using the print() function manually for each member.

#the next lines of code will print the organized output for each member manually, without using a loop. It does so by calling back the stored information in the dictionary in {} using the keys in []
#the \n is used to commant the print() to print the string following it in a new line.
